Icebreaker that won't make you hate icebreakers, brought to you by Design, Develop, Deploy @ Ohio State University


## Project Goal

Our goal was to build a web-based icebreaker that a host of a meeting, orientation, or even HR representative on the first day of your new job, can start and get everyone envolved and engaged. Once the host has started a session, all the individuals at the meeting can join, fill out a questionaire, and then get matched with others. The matching process happens by the participants finding others with the same color screen as them, and then answering questions about others. Once every one in the group has completed all the promoted questions that group will "win" the session, based on time and questions answered. 

But that's not all, all players and hosts can refer back to their sessions and see who was there so contacts can always be continuouslt shared.
